Hi! I am an assistant professor at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Economics, School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology.
I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, especially, probabilistic aspects of graph theory (e.g., random graph, random walk, etc) and its applications.
